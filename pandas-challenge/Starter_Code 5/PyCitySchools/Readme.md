# **School\_District\_Analysis**
## **Objective**
A school district asked for a snapshot of several key metrics by each school campus and by the district level. The main analysis focused on the performance of math and reading scores disaggregated several ways in preparation for a board meeting.

- Use Python and Pandas library to analyze school district data and showcase trends in school performance based on key metrics.
- Use Jupyter Notebook to visualize data outcomes as table format.
  - #### *District Summary*
  - #### *School Summary*
  - #### *Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)*
  - #### *Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)*
  - #### *Math Scores by Grade*
  - #### *Reading Scores by Grade*
  - #### *Scores by School Spending*
  - #### *Scores by School Size*
  - #### *Scores by School Type*
- This analysis assists the school board and district level in making decisions of budgets and priorities.
## **The process of project**
- Read raw data in csv file.
- Clean and inspect data, correct inappropriate data.
- Merge datasets to create new DataFrame gathering more information.
- Perform calculations for key metrics use groupby() function.
- Visualize data with tables to tell story and showcase trends.
## **Conclusion**
- Schools with higher budgets, did not yield better test results. However, schools with higher spending per student underperformed compared to schools with smaller budget. 
- Smaller and medium sized schools out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances.
- Charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics.
